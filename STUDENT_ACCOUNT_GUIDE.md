# Student Account CI/CD Setup Guide

## Current Situation
Your Azure for Students account has limited permissions and cannot create service principals in Azure Active Directory. This is a common restriction on educational accounts.

## Account Details
- **Subscription**: Azure for Students
- **Subscription ID**: df7dc967-963c-4518-82bf-e1f24714f060
- **Tenant**: Lambton College (mylambton.onmicrosoft.com)
- **User**: c0939678@mylambton.ca

## Available Options

### ✅ **Option 1: Local Development Only (Current Setup)**
Continue using Azure CLI authentication for local development:

```bash
# Your current working setup
az login
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**Pros**: 
- Works perfectly for learning and development
- No additional setup required
- Full Terraform functionality

**Cons**: 
- No automated CI/CD
- Manual deployment only

### ✅ **Option 2: Validation-Only CI/CD (Implemented)**
The GitHub Actions workflow now provides:
- ✅ Terraform syntax validation
- ✅ Format checking
- ✅ Basic configuration validation
- ❌ No actual deployment (requires manual deployment)

### 🔄 **Option 3: Request Enhanced Permissions**
Contact Lambton College IT department:

Subject: Azure Service Principal Creation Request

Hi IT Team,

I'm working on a Terraform infrastructure project for my coursework and need permission to create service principals in Azure Active Directory for CI/CD automation.

My account: c0939678@mylambton.ca
Subscription: Azure for Students (df7dc967-963c-4518-82bf-e1f24714f060)

Could you please grant me the "Application Developer" or "Cloud Application Administrator" role in Azure AD?

This would allow me to create service principals for automated deployments as part of my DevOps learning.

Thank you!
```

### 🎯 **Option 4: Alternative CI/CD Platform**
Consider using Azure DevOps instead of GitHub Actions:
- Often has better integration with student accounts
- May have different permission requirements
- Can use Azure DevOps service connections

## Current Workflow Features

### What Works in GitHub Actions:
1. **Code Validation**: Checks Terraform syntax and formatting
2. **Configuration Review**: Validates Terraform configuration
3. **Manual Trigger**: Workflow can be triggered manually
4. **Environment Protection**: Requires approval for different environments

### What Doesn't Work:
1. **Automated Deployment**: Cannot authenticate with Azure
2. **Resource Management**: Cannot create/modify Azure resources
3. **State Management**: Cannot use remote state with authentication

## Recommended Workflow for Students

### Development Process:
1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   # Make changes locally
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Version Control**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Validation**: GitHub Actions will validate your code automatically

4. **Deployment**: Manual deployment from your local machine

### Benefits of This Approach:
- ✅ Learn Terraform concepts and best practices
- ✅ Experience with version control and workflows
- ✅ Understand CI/CD pipeline concepts
- ✅ Practice with modular infrastructure code
- ✅ Security best practices (even without full automation)

## Learning Outcomes Achieved

Even without full CI/CD automation, you've learned:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Modular Terraform design
2. **Security**: Azure Key Vault, SSH key management, managed identities
3. **Networking**: VNet, subnets, NSGs, NAT Gateway
4. **CI/CD Concepts**: GitHub Actions, workflows, validation
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation
6. **Version Control**: Git branching, merging, collaboration

## Future Enhancements

When you have access to service principal creation:

1. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-github-sp.sh
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub secrets** with the output

3. **Enable full CI/CD** with the provided workflow

## Testing Your Current Setup

1. **Test the validation workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change to test validation
   echo "# Test change" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Test validation workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Check GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab to see validation results

3. **Deploy manually**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Summary

Your project is **complete and functional** for educational purposes! You have:
- ✅ Production-ready Terraform code
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ CI/CD workflow (validation only)
- ✅ All learning objectives met

The limitation is administrative (account permissions), not technical. Your code and setup are enterprise-grade!
